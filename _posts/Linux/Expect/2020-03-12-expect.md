# Expect란?
> Introduction  :
Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in X11 GUIs.  
Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively difficult with anything else. You will find that Expect is an absolutely invaluable tool - using it, you will be able to automate tasks that you've never even thought of before - and you'll be able to do this automation quickly and easily.

Telnet, FTP, SSH 등과 같은 응용 프로그램을 자동으로 상호작용하며 제어하기 위한 프로그램입니다.  

국내에는 Expect를 많이 사용하지 않는지, 관련 자료들이 그리 많지 않네요...  
그 중 제타위키에 Expect가 어떤건지 이해하기 좋은 예제들이 잘 정리되어 있습니다.[(제타위키:expect)](https://zetawiki.com/wiki/%EB%A6%AC%EB%88%85%EC%8A%A4_expect)
